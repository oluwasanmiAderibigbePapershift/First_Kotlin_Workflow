# First_Kotlin_Workflow

A play ground for kotlin workflow. I am actively learning the framework so free feel to drop a comment or two where you think the code could be better.

It currently contains three samples:
1. A calculator that adds two numbers
2. An app that validates an email field.
3. An app that validates a form.

## TODO
1. Implement simple Backscreen
2. Implement complex Backscreen with mutiple screens.
3. Implement API call
4. Impement authentication.
5. Implement endless scroll list
6. Implement Database and sharedpref storage.
7. Implement basic dialog.
8. Impement basic testing.
